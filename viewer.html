    	 	    hope you may ne</span><span class="line" id="ln6">ver have to say that you wish you had never had a Son, as I dare
    	 	    </span><span class="line" id="ln7">say many have, but to the contrary I hope we shall live to be a pleasure </span><span class="line" id="ln8">to you
    	 	    in time. We have been as well as common except the splean which </span><span class="line" id="ln9">is as bad as

    	 	    less </span><span class="line" id="ln21">than a Month: and that <sup>his</sup> other business
    	 	    is so that he cannot attend to </span><span class="line" id="ln22">boarders, and he intends if he can to get 
    	 	    <span title="@reg">M<sup>r</sup> Taylor</span> to board us </span><span class="line" id="ln23">if he will trust you untill you
    	 	    come up as he generally has a </span><span class="line" id="ln24">quarter or half at enrance, he is not at home at
    	 	    present if he had </span><span class="line" id="ln25">been I should have known whither he would have taken us or
    	 	    </span><span class="line" id="ln26">not; he went away a day or two before I knew any thing of this, </span><span class="line" id="ln27">and I don't

    	 	    expect you will be </span><span class="line" id="ln29">up about the end of August, or the first of September
    	 	    however it </span><span class="line" id="ln30">will be necessary you <sup>should</sup> come by

    	 	    will amount </span><span class="line" id="ln37">to 5 dollars a year each I for my part am very sorry </span><span class="line" id="ln38">we did not
    	 	    board at commons first; I thaught there was </span><span class="line" id="ln39">no certainty nor regularity in
    	 	    <span style="text-decoration:line-through">them</span> such Cabbins; there </span><span class="line" id="ln40">is not one
    	 	    Student except <span title="@reg">M<sup>r</sup> Daniels</span> Son and our</span><span class="line" id="ln41">selve but what board
    		  at Commons. 
    		  M<sup>r</sup> Yergans fa</span><span class="line" id="ln42">mily was taken sickly and his two boarders
    	 	    that </span><span class="line" id="ln43">he had board now at the Colledge. I believe there is </span><span class="line" id="ln44">21 studying Latin,
    		  and 5 or six English. 
    	 	    <span title="@reg">M<sup>rs</sup> Kimbel</span> has </span><span class="line" id="ln45">been very sick this few days and I have
